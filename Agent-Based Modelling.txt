Historical Background 
• Agent-based modelling is a comparably young modelling technique.
• Were inspired by Cellular Automata (Von Neumann, Ulam, etc)
• Thomas Schelling‘s Model of Segregation (1971) is broadly denoted as 
the first agent-based model

Agent Based 
Model (ABM)
Each agent (= person) is 
assigned a colour
(blue or red) and a cell
agent


A Small but Powerful Difference…
for C in Cellspace:
if C is not white:
N(C) = neighbourhood of C
do update rules with C w.r. to N(C)
Update Cellspace
for A in AgentList:
get cell and color of A
find neighboured agents N(A)
do some actions with A w.r. to N(A)
Update AgentList
ABM
CA Model
Pseudocode representation of a time step in Schelling‘s model.
In principle both representations make sense for this 
application. Yet Schelling used the second concept to 
describe the model for its benefits.

describe the model for its benefits.
We could distinguish
between male and female
agents (persons) 
We do not have to
use a cell-space
It could be some „grayscales“ 
in between if we want to
We could add some
immigrants
We could introduce
death of agents
We do not have to use
a dicrete time-step! 
ABM
We could include
more realistic
distributions
It is easier to explain the
model as it is a more natural
description!


WHAT IS AN AGENT-BASED MODEL


What is an Agent?
Why Agent?


What is an Agent?
Latin: „agere“ (to act)


What is an Agent?
• Agent – lat. agere (act)
• There is no unique definition. The word is very broadly used.
[Agent-based modelling is...] 
„Rather a general concept“
(Winter Simulation Conference 2005 & 2006)


What is an Agent?
▪With respect to Winter Simulation Conference (2005 & 2006) an agent has to...
... be uniquely identifiable
... cohabitate an environment with other agents, and has to be able to 
communicate with them.
... be able to act targeted.
... be autonomous and independent.
... be able to change its behaviour.

Short Summary
• Agent-Based modelling is a bottom up modelling approach using a big number of 
individual system components (agents).
• The components act independently (following given rules)
• As it requires a lot of processing resources ABM is a very young science with high 
potential.

Flexibility
• Change of details is very easy compared to other (especially macroscopic) 
modelling approaches.
• Different parameterisation of single agents does not require changes within the 
system structure. 
• Change or addition of (meta) rules for single agents does not influence the 
system structure as well (as long as they remain compatible with the system).

Natural description of the System
•
Components of the system look like in reality
•
Parameters can be seen like data or properties of individuals in reality

No mathematical background knowledge is required in order to understand the

Natural description of the System


Beware of wrong ideas!
• Natural description of the system makes the
model easier to communicate
• Therefore it is often regarded as more credible
by non-experts
BUT
VALID-LOOKING != VALID


Example: Disease Spread Model
How does an infectious disease 
spread?
Both models look reasonable…


Interpretation of Agent-Based Model Results
Basically two classes of 
agent-based models can 
be observed
ABMs for quantitative
investigation
•
Usually interested in 
temporal behaviour of
aggregate numbers
•
Usually used for some
kind of resource
planning
ABMs for qualitative 
investigation
•
Usually interested in 
(temporal behaviour) of
patterns
•
Usually used for 
foundamental scientific
research

Summary: Properties of Agent-Based Models
Agent-based models are good in…
•
… analysis and discovery of complex group dynamic behaviour. This must not 
necessarily be a good thing as emergent behaviour may occur in models even if
it is not correct.
•
… communitcating models to non-experts. 
The modelling appoach is easy to understand, picturesque and no mathematical
background is necessary.


Summary: Properties of Agent-Based Models
Agent-based models are good in…
•
… analysis and discovery of complex group dynamic behaviour. 
•
… communitcating models to non-experts. 
Agent-based modelling is problematic …
• … regards misinterpretation. If it looks like reality it must not necessarily be a 
valid model for it. 
• … regards the validation process. Validation of ABMs is a difficult task due to
complex model behaviour.
• … regards computer ressources. ABMs require high performance CPUs and a lot
of RAM.

– If 𝑥−𝑦< 𝜏, the two start discussing and
𝑥←𝑥+ 𝜇𝑦−𝑥
𝑦←𝑦−𝜇(𝑦−𝑥)
– Otherwise
𝑥←𝑥

Case Study 5: Opinion Dynamics
• Picturesque model to show, how communities with 
different opinions develop (e.g. Political parties,...)


Case Study 5: Opinion Dynamics
• Options to investigate different 
topological structures of the contact
network and contact behaviour


Case Study 5: Lessons Learned
Lesson 8: Use configuration files and unique scenario Ids
not to lose track of the different created results. Make
sure that the mapping between configuration and result
is reproducible
Think about reproducibility of
random events

Enable serialisation and 
deserialisation or agents?
Lesson 9: Think about splitting initialisation and 
execution process. E.g. generation of random networks
or initial sampling might take long.

Classification of ABMs (5)
Classification 5
with respect to randomness (stochasticity)
stochastic
deterministic
initial-value stochastic
update stochastic
•
Initial setting (of 
agents) is determined 
using random 
numbers
•
Update rules 
user random 
numbers
•
The outcome of the 
model is uniquely 
defined by its initial 
condition


Summary
When developing an agent-based model particularly care for ...
• ... order of actions / simultaneous events
• ... correct result interpretation
(randomness , quantitative/qualitative, ...)
• … reproducible experimental design (configuration files …)
• ... code performance
• ... reproducible documentation(s)
