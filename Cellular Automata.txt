Introduction to Cellular Automata


BASIC CONCEPTS


Cellular Automata
• Modelling using „cellular automata“, 
short CA, is a microscopic simulation
method
• Cellular automata can be imagined as a 
coloured grid observed dynamically
Although this is a very simplified image of a CA, 
keep it in mind to understand the formal details of
this concept


Components of a CA
• Cells


Components of a CA
• Cells
▪
Notations: cell, entity, node
▪
Cells are passive: no internal dynamic, only container 
for some information
▪
Each cell has some state.


Components of a CA
• Cells
• States
• State-space
▪
Every Cell has a state
▪
There is always some space 𝕊that contains all 
possible states. It is usually called state-space.

▪
All cells are arranged on some lattice structure: the
„cell-space“ – in the simplest case, a rectangular grid.
▪
There is some index mapping that maps some subset 
of I ⊂ℤ𝑑 onto each cell

Some examples:


Neighbourhood
• The neighbourhood mapping is relative to the cell’s position (= index)
• Calculation of neighbouring cells by stencil: Index translations yield the 
positions (index) of n neighboring cells: 𝑖↦𝑖+ 𝑡1, … 𝑖+ 𝑡𝑛
(𝑖, 𝑗)
(𝑚, 𝑛)
(𝑘, 𝑙)


Neighbourhood
• Possible characteristics of neighbourhoods:
▪local: the neighbourhood consists of cells of neighboring points on the grid
▪symmetric: the neighborhood of cell A contains cell B if and only if the
neighborhood of cell B contains cell A


Neighbourhood
• Classic, popular neighborhoods
Moore

Von-Neumann

Neighbourhood by distance:

Neighbourhood
• The index set is limited →either incomplete neighborhoods for cells
near the borders 𝑧1, 𝑧2, ∅, 𝑧4 … , 𝑧𝑛….
…or other compensation ideas.

the CA. 
Maps all states of a cell’s neighbourhood to a new state for the 
cell.

The update function needs to
be capable to deal with
incomplete neighbourhoods as
well


Updates
▪Updates happen for all cells simultaneously.
– Neighborhoods are all computed from the same system state
– Update order of cells is irrelevant
Why?

Iteratively apply the update rule on the complete CA


Iterations
▪Define discrete, equidistant time points (all time steps between time 
points are of the same length): 𝑡0, 𝑡1,…,𝑡𝑛
▪Every update of states brings the model to the next time point
➢Cellular Automaton (CA)


Iterations
▪Tasks for one iterations
– Compute the neighbors of all cells
– Determine states of all cells, and states of all neighbours of all cells
– Compute state updates for all cells and store them
– Apply the updated states for all cells

         time 𝑡1

Properties of CA models
Cellular Automata are microscopic simulation models that are capable of producing almost
arbitrarily complex, up to chaotic, behaviour.
They are, hence, not only
a very powerful, but also
a very dangerous
modelling approach with
respect to validity.

Properties of CA models
Cellular Automata are microscopic simulation models that are capable of producing almost

Stephen Wolfram
(A New Kind of Science, 2002)
stated that CAs may have one
of the four types of
behavour:
fixed, cyclic, complex, chaotic
Chris Langton developed

(1,2, … , 𝑏) or on 𝐼= ℤ2.

▪Update rules:
– An alive cell with fewer than two or more than three 
alive neighbors dies (“under-population” or 
“overcrowding”)
– A dead cell with exactly three alive neighbors 
becomes alive (“reproduction”)
– Cells keep their state in any other case

▪Why “Game of Life”?
– Teaching purposes
– Academic competitions
– Fundamental/methodological research
– Game → figures
Probably worst example for a Cellular Automata
simulation model,…
…but probably the best example to show the
concepts of CAs.

As it seemed as if any starting configuration of the GoL
resulted in a static or oscillating end-configuration, Conway 
offered a price of 50$ for a pattern that resulted in an 
infinitely growing population.

Nagel-Schreckenberg-Model
• discretisation of a road or motorway into cells of approximately 4m
• possible states:
– 𝑠 =  0: no vehicle
– 𝑠 >  0: speed of vehicle
• update rules (implicitly defined!):
– accelerate: IF 𝑣 <  𝑣_max AND next vehicle 𝑣+ 1 cells away THEN 𝑣(𝑡+ 1) =
 𝑣(𝑡) +  1
– brake: IF next vehicle 𝑗 cells away AND 𝑗< 𝑣 THEN
 𝑣(𝑡+ 1) =  𝑗 –  1
– randomisation: 𝑣(𝑡+ 1) =  𝑣(𝑡) –  1 with a certain probability
– movement: 𝑠(𝑡+ 1) =  𝑠(𝑡) +  𝑣(𝑡)

LATTICE GAS CELLULAR AUTOMATA (LGCA)
Example


Lattice Gas Cellular Automata
▪Lattice Gas Cellular Automata (LGCA)
▪Extension of the CA concept
▪Intention: Simulate fluids and gases
▪Invented by Hardy, Pomeau and de Pazzis (HPP automaton on square 
lattice), 1973 
▪Improved by Frisch, Hasslacher and Pomeau (FHP automaton on 
hexagonal grid), 1986


Lattice Gas Cellular Automata
• Ideas
▪Cells do not have states but instead can contain particles
▪A particle can only proceed to a cell in the neighborhood
▪Instead of state updates, particles move to other cells
▪Particles represent the fluid or the gas


Lattice Gas Cellular Automata
• HPP
▪square grid, Von-Neumann neighborhood, max. 4 particles per cell so that 
max. 1 particle goes to each neighbor
▪several issues when it comes to real interpretations (comparison with real 
fluids, validation)


Lattice Gas Cellular Automata
• FHP
▪hexagonal grid
▪neighborhood = surrounding cells
▪max. 6 particles per cell, each going into a different direction → consistent 
definition
▪Corresponds to the Navier-Stokes-Equations → valid representation of 
fluid dynamics


FHP Model
neighbourhood
particles and directions


FHP Model
▪Particle movements consist of two phases
– Rotation of cells for special configurations
– Movements of particles into their direction
▪Developed by Wolf-Gladrow (2000)
▪Different variations (FHP-I, FHP-II, FHP-III)


FHP Model
• Rotations
▪In the most simple case of FHP-I 
only for two situations
▪Provide a randomness

EPIDEMIC SIMULATION

• Simulate the spread of an epidemics
• Susceptible (S) people become infected by infectous (I) and become
resistant/recovered (R) after some time.
• Resistant persons cannot be infected again.

CA Implementation
CA Implementation of SIR epidemics:
• Every cell in a rectangular (hexagonal..) lattice represents a 
person/group of persons/household/…
• Infecious cells recover after some time (with some probability).
• Infectious cells may spread the disease to their neighbours (e.g. Moore 
neighbourhood)


LGCA Implementation
LGCA Implementation of SIR epidemics:
• Every cell in a rectangular (hexagonal..) lattice contains a number of
persons (e.g. 4)
• Infecious persons recover after some time (with some probability).
• Infectious persons may spread the disease to all other persons in the
cell
